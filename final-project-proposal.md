#### The tentative project title

#### The motivation for this project

#### The intended final products

To the end, we are expected to create several interactive dashboards of
the relationship between the travel time differences and comparisons of
the public traffic (citibike/bus/subway/taxi) within daytime across the
Manhattan area in New York. Analyzing the factors that might influence
the actual travel time could reflect the road congestion situation in
New York.

#### The anticipated data sources

-   NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission Trip Record Data:
    <https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page>
